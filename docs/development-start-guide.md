### The `.storybook` Directory

### The `docs` Directory

Documents

### The `src` Directory

This directory contains Ripple components packages `/src/components/` and storybook components `/src/storybook-components/`. It will be changed soon, please refer to `packages` directory.

### The `packages` Directory

In later we will take Ripple components packages out of `/src/components/` and put it in `/packages` directory.

### The `static` Directory

**Assets for Ripple component should not be added in here.**

This directory contains static files for our storybook site. For example, images used for demo purpose.

Then you can use the image in any `story.js` by path like `'/logo.svg'`.

### The `storybook-static` Directory

Auto generated by `build-storybook` for static app deployment.
